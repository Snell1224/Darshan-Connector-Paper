\section{Future Work}
\RED{Taking a stab at this} This paper covered the \Darshan design and implementation of the \connector which collected I/O data from an I/O characterization tool to create a new timeseries that allows for further insights into I/O behavior and patterns. Five key components were used to develop this design which were the I/O event data (Darshan), data collection (LDMS Streams), storage (DSOS), analysis (Python modules) and visualization (Grafana).
These results of this design proved to enhance both LDMS and Darshan tools as well as create new insights and provide a better understanding to application I/O performance and behavior. 

The next steps are to further expand the \connector and it's capabilities by including more I/O event data and demonstrating advanced insights into correlations between I/O performance and system behavior. We hope the \Darshan will be available as an optional "module" plugin in Darshan so their users may use this tool to better understand their applications I/O performance across HPC systems and clusters.
