This section covers what significance of the approach to collecting
runtime application I/O data and how the new analyses helped provide
more insight into I/O behavior. Figure \ref{a}

Figure \ref{f:mpi_io} shows the duration of the reads and writes per
rank for each execution (\texttt{job\_id} metric) of the MPI-IO
benchmark without using collective operations. We notice a similar
behavior for the I/O operations duration for all jobs except the
second one. It presents a mean duration of 6.75 seconds for reads and
78s for writes, while the other jobs had a mean duration of 0.05s for
reads and 54s for writes. In fact, a single application can have
multiple unique I/O behavior that can degradate the performance of the
application \cite{costa2021}. With the collected logs, we can perform
a spatial performance analysis to understand the variability in the
I/O behavior per system component, in this case, per nodes and
ranks.

      We can temporaly view the occurences of writes and read
      throughout the total application execution time, and correlate
      with other log informations, such as the ranks perform I/O
      operations and their durations.

   timestamps show valuable insights and we can also see this behavior
 on Grafana.}
