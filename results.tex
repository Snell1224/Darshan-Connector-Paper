\section{Results}


This section covers what significance of the approach to collecting runtime application I/O data and how the new analyses helped provide more insight into I/O behavior.

 \RED{ADD 1 or 2 plots of HACC application for opens and closes as well (interesting results in Grafana)}
 
\RED{Show MPI-IO without collective operations results for read/write, and
will show other plots for other applications.}

 \RED{ADD text about the 3 plots building a narrative how the
   timestamps show valuable insights and we can also see this behavior
 on Grafana.}
