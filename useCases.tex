\section{Use Cases}\label{AA}
This section provides various use cases of the \Darshan timeseries data that will be used to create new meaningful analyses and insights in the I/O performance variability during an application run.

\RED{Explain the different scenarios we will be testing:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Applications: SWFFT, sw4, sw4lite. Standard baseline: mpi-test. 
		\item Explain what each application does, why it's being tested and how the test was performed (i.e. number of nodes, etc.)
		\item Explain the analysis used to analyze the I/O data and how they provide further insight into the I/O behavior and can allow for correlations between I/O performance and system behavior.
		\item show Grafana graphs, Darshan output (maybe) JSON and any tables (if applicable).
\end{itemize}}


\subsection{Results}
This section covers what significance of the approach to collecting runtime application I/O data and how the new analyses helped provide more insight into I/O behavior.
\RED{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analyse the results of the use cases
		\item What is the significance of the results?
		\item Throw in a picture of the Grafana Dashboard for each use case
		\item How do these results satisfy and solve the problems described in the the "Problems and Approach" section.
	\end{itemize}
